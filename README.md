# Getting Started with a Mobile Web Application Project - Mobile Chatbot
## Purpose of the project

Grace's Hardware Shop is loosing customers to grocery stores because essential workers can't just stop buy on their way home from work and pick things up that they need to manage their house.So I thought to create an application for the customers to purchase Home essentials items from the listed category via text message and pick things from curbside pickup area.

## Prerequisites
First of all, we need to install Node.js and Paypal developer sandbox account

## How to build the project

### Open visual Studio code or command prompt from a new folder and run below commands

To clone the project, run 

### `git clone https://github.com/Grace-pauly/mobile-chatbot-8560-assignment3.git .`

To run Application,
1. Sign in to the paypal developer sandbox and get a `client id`
2. The first time run `npm install`
3. Then run `SB_CLIENT_ID=<put_in_your_client_id> npm start`
